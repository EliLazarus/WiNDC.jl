We use additional data from the BEA on regional gross product and consumer expenditures and data from the Census Bureau on foreign trade and state government expenditures. We show how to combine publicly available data from these sources and other government agencies to compile a database that serves as input data for the core WiNDC buildstream. The core WiNDC buildstream generates the core WiNDC database. The database contains multisectoral subnational economic datasets for the years 1997 to 2021.","category":"page"},{"location":"data/overview/#Data-Module","page":"Data Module","title":"Data Module","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"data/overview/","page":"Data Module","title":"Data Module","text":"We have assembled all of this data for download to run locally.
