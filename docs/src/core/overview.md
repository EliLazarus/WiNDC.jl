# Core Module Overview


We begin with the national [input-output table](https://www.bea.gov/industry/io_annual.htm) of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and downscale to the regional level using publicly available economic statistics from government agencies. We use additional data from the BEA on [regional gross product](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/qgsp_newsrelease.htm) and [consumer expenditures](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/pce/pce_newsrelease.htm) and data from the Census Bureau on [foreign trade](https://usatrade.census.gov/) and [state government expenditures](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/state/data/tables.All.html). We show how to combine publicly available data from these sources and other government agencies to compile a database that serves as input data for the core WiNDC buildstream. The core WiNDC buildstream generates the core WiNDC database. The database contains multisectoral subnational economic datasets for the years 1997 to 2021.
