# State Disaggregation Model

```@docs
state_disaggregation_model_mcp_year(GU::GamsUniverse,year::Symbol)
state_disaggregation_model_mcp(GU::GamsUniverse)
```

To Do:

1. Create documentation explaining exactly what the model is doing
2. Currently this model is hard-coded to be the benchmark
verification. Need to make modifications to also run a 
counterfactual.
