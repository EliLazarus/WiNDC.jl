# Data Module

We have assembled all of this data for [download](https://windc.wisc.edu/downloads/version_4_0/windc_2021_julia.zip)
to run locally. This information is provided if you are interested in updating 
data early, without using the API.

When manually updating data, you may need to modify the file `data_information.json` with 
updated paths to the files. A JSON file is raw text and can be modified in any text editor.
It should be straight forward to open the file and determine what needs updating. 




# API Access

This is currently not available, but under active development. Expect updates in early 2024.
